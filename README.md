# CrystalDB

This is the official repository for the CrystalDB Node.js Module. CrystalDB is a Node.js module. This module is a NoSQL, JSON Database System. This system works similarly to other JSON Document Systems, but is boiled down, for simpler projects, where large database systems are not required. This system does all of the computing, and storing in the module, so all you have to do, is simply pass through, the file ID, and the data.
